# krnl_auto_update
A quick python script to auto update the executer krnl



This was made in about 4 hours so its not perfect

how to run

step 1: Install python and the latest version of selenium, along with any version of firefox, and turn safe downloads off

step 2: Fork repo and wherever you see 'penis' in a directory, change it to your windows name(I was too lazy to automate that this morning my bad also fuck you linux idk what you should put in the directories)

step 3: Download krnl auto update.py, and geckodriver.exe

step 4: Add geckodriver.exe to windows path(Look it up I forgot how)

step 5: Run krnl auto update.py, and hope for the best

ps. if anyone actually downloads this you can make task manager run this script whenever you turn on your pc.
